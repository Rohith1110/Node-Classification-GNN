# Graph Neural Network for Node Classification
This repository implements and trains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for node-level multiclass classification tasks. In this framework, datasets are represented as directed graphs, with each cell treated as a node. The GNN learns node embeddings using the supergraph of the training dataset, predicting classes based on node features and edge connections.

### Requirements
Python 3.x
PyTorch
PyTorch Geometric
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

### Instructions
Install Required Libraries: pip install torch torch-geometric scikit-learn matplotlib

Visualizations: Visualization files will be generated in the root directory, displaying node embeddings before and after training.

### Example Outputs
Visualizations from previous experiments can be found in the repository.
Both Visualisations are available.
